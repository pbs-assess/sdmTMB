#' Fit a spatial or spatiotemporal GLMM with TMB
#'
#' Fit a spatial or spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM)
#' with the TMB (Template Model Builder) R package and the SPDE (stochastic
#' partial differential equation) approximation to Gaussian random fields.
#'
#' @param formula Model formula. IID random intercepts are possible using
#'   \pkg{lme4} syntax, e.g., `+ (1 | g)` where `g` is a column of class
#'   character or factor representing groups. Penalized splines are possible via
#'   \pkg{mgcv} with `s()`. Optionally a list for delta (hurdle) models.  See
#'   examples and details below.
#' @param data A data frame.
#' @param mesh An object from [make_mesh()].
#' @param time An optional time column name (as character). Can be left as
#'   `NULL` for a model with only spatial random fields; however, if the data
#'   are actually spatiotemporal and you wish to use [get_index()] or [get_cog()]
#'   downstream, supply the time argument.
#' @param family The family and link. Supports [gaussian()], [Gamma()],
#'   [binomial()], [poisson()], \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{Beta()}},
#'   \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{nbinom2()}},

#'   \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{delta_lognormal()}}, and
#'   \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{delta_truncated_nbinom2()}},
#'   For binomial family options, see 'Binomial families' in the Details
#'   section below.
#' @param spatial Estimate spatial random fields? Options are `'on'` / `'off'`
#'   or `TRUE` / `FALSE`. Optionally, a list for delta models, e.g. `list('on',
#'   'off')`.
#' @param spatiotemporal Estimate the spatiotemporal random fields as `'iid'`
#'   (independent and identically distributed; default), stationary `'ar1'`
#'   (first-order autoregressive), a random walk (`'rw'`), or fixed at 0
#'   `'off'`. Will be set to `'off'` if `time = NULL`. If a delta model, can be
#'   a list. E.g., `list('off', 'ar1')`. Note that the spatiotemporal standard
#'   deviation represents the marginal steady-state standard deviation of the
#'   process in the case of the AR1. I.e., it is scaled according to the
#'   correlation. See the [TMB
#'   documentation](https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/classdensity_1_1AR1__t.html).
#'   If the AR1 correlation coefficient (rho) is estimated close to 1,
#'   say > 0.99, then you may wish to switch to the random walk `'rw'`.
#'   Capitalization is ignored. `TRUE` gets converted to `'iid'` and `FALSE`
#'   gets converted to `'off'`.
#' @param share_range Logical: estimate a shared spatial and spatiotemporal
#'   range parameter (`TRUE`, default) or independent range parameters
#'   (`FALSE`). If a delta model, can be a list. E.g., `list(TRUE, FALSE)`.
#' @param time_varying An optional one-sided formula describing covariates
#'   that should be modelled as a time-varying process. Set the type of
#'   process with `time_varying_type`. See the help for `time_varying_type`
#'   for warnings about modelling the first time step. Structure shared in
#'   delta models.
#' @param time_varying_type Type of time-varying process to apply to
#'   `time_varying` formula. `'rw'` indicates a random walk with the first
#'   time step estimated independently (included for legacy reasons), `'rw0'`
#'   indicates a random walk with the first time step estimated with
#'   a mean-zero normal prior, `'ar1'` indicates a [stationary first-order
#'   autoregressive process](https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/classdensity_1_1AR1__t.html)
#'   with the first time step estimated with a mean-zero prior. In the case of
#'   `'rw'`, be careful not to include covariates (including the intercept) in
#'   both the main and time-varying formula since the first time step is
#'   estimated independently. I.e., in this case, at least one should have `~
#'   0` or `~ -1`. Structure shared in delta models.
#' @param spatial_varying An optional one-sided formula of coefficients that
#'   should vary in space as random fields. Note that you likely want to include
#'   a fixed effect for the same variable to improve interpretability since the
#'   random field is assumed to have a mean of 0. If a (scaled) time column is
#'   used, it will represent a local-time-trend model. See
#'   \doi{10.1111/ecog.05176} and the [spatial trends
#'   vignette](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/spatial-trend-models.html).
#'   Note this predictor should usually be centered to have mean zero and have a
#'   standard deviation of approximately 1.
#'   **The spatial intercept is controlled by the `spatial` argument**; therefore,
#'   include or exclude the spatial intercept by setting `spatial = 'on'` or
#'   `'off'`. The only time when it matters whether `spatial_varying` excludes
#'   an intercept is in the case of factor predictors. In this case, if
#'   `spatial_varying` excludes the intercept (`~ 0` or `~ -1`), you should set
#'   `spatial = 'off'` to match.  Structure must be shared in delta models.
#' @param weights A numeric vector representing optional likelihood weights for
#'   the conditional model. Implemented as in \pkg{glmmTMB}: weights do not have
#'   to sum to one and are not internally modified. Can also be used for trials
#'   with the binomial family; the `weights` argument needs to be a vector and not
#'   a name of the variable in the data frame. See the Details section below.
#' @param offset A numeric vector representing the model offset *or* a character
#'   value representing the column name of the offset. In delta/hurdle models,
#'   this applies only to the positive component. Usually a log transformed
#'   variable.
#' @param extra_time Optional extra time slices (e.g., years) to include for
#'   interpolation or forecasting with the predict function. See the Details
#'   section below.
#' @param reml Logical: use REML (restricted maximum likelihood) estimation
#'   rather than maximum likelihood? Internally, this adds the fixed effects to
#'   the list of random effects to integrate over.
#' @param silent Silent or include optimization details? Helpful to set to
#'   `FALSE` for models that take a while to fit.
#' @param anisotropy Logical: allow for anisotropy (spatial correlation that is
#'   directionally dependent)? See [plot_anisotropy()].
#'   Must be shared across delta models.
#' @param control Optimization control options via [sdmTMBcontrol()].
#' @param priors Optional penalties/priors via [sdmTMBpriors()]. Must currently
#'   be shared across delta models.
#' @param knots Optional named list containing knot values to be used for basis
#'   construction of smoothing terms. See [mgcv::gam()] and [mgcv::gamm()].
#'   E.g., `s(x, bs = 'cc', k = 4), knots = list(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4))`
#' @param previous_fit A previously fitted sdmTMB model to initialize the
#'   optimization with. Can greatly speed up fitting. Note that the model must
#'   be set up *exactly* the same way. However, the data and `weights` arguments
#'   can change, which can be useful for cross-validation.
#' @param do_fit Fit the model (`TRUE`) or return the processed data without
#'   fitting (`FALSE`)?
#' @param do_index Do index standardization calculations while fitting? Saves
#'   memory and time when working with large datasets or projection grids since
#'   the TMB object doesn't have to be rebuilt with [predict.sdmTMB()] and
#'   [get_index()]. If `TRUE`, then `predict_args` must have a `newdata` element
#'   supplied and `area` can be supplied to `index_args`.
#' @param predict_args A list of arguments to pass to [predict.sdmTMB()] if
#'   `do_index = TRUE`.
#' @param index_args A list of arguments to pass to [get_index()] if
#'   `do_index = TRUE`. Currently, only `area` is supported. Bias correction
#'   can be done when calling [get_index()] on the resulting fitted object.
#' @param bayesian Logical indicating if the model will be passed to
#'   \pkg{tmbstan}. If `TRUE`, Jacobian adjustments are applied to account for
#'   parameter transformations when priors are applied.
#' @param experimental A named list for esoteric or in-development options. Here
#'   be dragons.
#   (Experimental) A column name (as character) of a predictor of a
#   linear trend (in log space) of the spatiotemporal standard deviation. By
#   default, this is `NULL` and fits a model with a constant spatiotemporal
#   variance. However, this argument can also be a character name in the
#   original data frame (a covariate that ideally has been standardized to have
#   mean 0 and standard deviation = 1). Because the spatiotemporal field varies
#   by time step, the standardization should be done by time. If the name of a
#   predictor is included, a log-linear model is fit where the predictor is
#   used to model effects on the standard deviation, e.g. `log(sd(i)) = B0 + B1
#   * epsilon_predictor(i)`. The 'epsilon_model' argument may also be
#   specified. This is the name of the model to use to modeling time-varying
#   epsilon. This can be one of the following: "trend" (default, fits a linear
#   model without random effects), "re" (fits a model with random effects in
#   epsilon_st, but no trend), and "trend-re" (a model that includes both the
#   trend and random effects)

#' **Model description**
#'
#' See the [model description](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/model-description.html)
#' vignette or the relevant appendix of the preprint on sdmTMB:
#' \doi{10.1101/2022.03.24.485545}
#'
#' **Binomial families**
#'
#' Following the structure of [stats::glm()] and \pkg{glmmTMB}, a binomial
#' family can be specified in one of 4 ways: (1) the response may be a factor
#' (and the model classifies the first level versus all others), (2) the
#' response may be binomial (0/1), (3) the response can be a matrix of form
#' `cbind(success, failure)`, and (4) the response may be the observed
#' proportions, and the 'weights' argument is used to specify the Binomial size
#' (N) parameter (`prob ~ ..., weights = N`).
#'
#' **Smooth terms**
#'
#' Smooth terms can be included following GAMs (generalized additive models)
#' using `+ s(x)`, which implements a smooth from [mgcv::s()]. \pkg{sdmTMB} uses
#' penalized smooths, constructed via [mgcv::smooth2random()]. This is a similar
#' approach implemented in \pkg{gamm4} and \pkg{brms}, among other packages.
#' Within these smooths, the same syntax commonly used in [mgcv::s()] or
#' [mgcv::t2()] can be applied, e.g. 2-dimensional smooths may be constructed
#' with `+ s(x, y)` or `+ t2(x, y)`; smooths can be specific to various factor
#' levels, `+ s(x, by = group)`; the basis function dimensions may be specified,
#' e.g. `+ s(x, k = 4)`; and various types of splines may be constructed such as
#' cyclic splines to model seasonality (perhaps with the `knots` argument also
#' be supplied).
#'
#' **Threshold models**
#'
#' A linear break-point relationship for a covariate can be included via
#' `+ breakpt(variable)` in the formula, where `variable` is a single covariate
#' corresponding to a column in `data`. In this case, the relationship is linear
#' up to a point and then constant (hockey-stick shaped).
#'
#' Similarly, a logistic-function threshold model can be included via
#' `+ logistic(variable)`. This option models the relationship as a logistic
#' function of the 50% and 95% values. This is similar to length- or size-based
#' selectivity in fisheries, and is parameterized by the points at which f(x) =
#' 0.5 or 0.95. See the
#' [threshold vignette](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/threshold-models.html).
#'
#' Note that only a single threshold covariate can be included and the same covariate
#' is included in both components for the delta families.
#'
#' **Extra time: forecasting or interpolating**
#'
#' Extra time slices (e.g., years) can be included for interpolation or
#' forecasting with the predict function via the `extra_time` argument. The
#' predict function requires all time slices to be defined when fitting the
#' model to ensure the various time indices are set up correctly. Be careful if
#' including extra time slices that the model remains identifiable. For example,
#' including `+ as.factor(year)` in `formula` will render a model with no data
#' to inform the expected value in a missing year. [sdmTMB()] makes no attempt
#' to determine if the model makes sense for forecasting or interpolation. The
#' options `time_varying`, `spatiotemporal = "rw"`, `spatiotemporal = "ar1"`,
#' or a smoother on the time column provide mechanisms to predict over missing
#' time slices with process error.
#'
#' `extra_time` can also be used to fill in missing time steps for the purposes
#' of a random walk or AR(1) process if the gaps between time steps are uneven.
#'
#' **Regularization and priors**
#'
#' You can achieve regularization via penalties (priors) on the fixed effect
#' parameters. See [sdmTMBpriors()]. You can fit the model once without
#' penalties and look at the output of `print(your_model)` or `tidy(your_model)`
#' or fit the model with `do_fit = FALSE` and inspect
#' `head(your_model$tmb_data$X_ij[[1]])` if you want to see how the formula is
#' translated to the fixed effect model matrix. Also see the
#' [Bayesian vignette](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/bayesian.html).
#'
#' **Delta/hurdle models**
#'
#' Delta models (also known as hurdle models) can be fit as two separate models
#' or at the same time by using an appropriate delta family. E.g.:
#'   \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{delta_gamma()}},
#'   \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{delta_beta()}},
#'   \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{delta_lognormal()}}, and
#'   \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{delta_truncated_nbinom2()}}.
#' If fit with a delta family, by default the formula, spatial, and spatiotemporal
#' components are shared. Some elements can be specified independently for the two models
#' using a list format. These include `formula`, `spatial`, `spatiotemporal`,
#' and `share_range`. The first element of the list is for the binomial component
#' and the second element is for the positive component (e.g., Gamma).
#' Other elements must be shared for now (e.g., spatially varying coefficients,
#' time-varying coefficients). Furthermore, there are currently limitations if
#' specifying two formulas as a list: the two formulas cannot have smoothers,
#' threshold effects, or random intercepts. For now, these must be specified
#' through a single formula that is shared across the two models.
#'
#' The main advantage of specifying such models using a delta family (compared
#' to fitting two separate models) is (1) coding simplicity and (2) calculation
#' of uncertainty on derived quantities such as an index of abundance with
#' [get_index()] using the generalized delta method within TMB. Also, selected
#' parameters can be shared across the models.
#'
#' See the [delta-model vignette](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/delta-models.html).
#'
#' **Index standardization**
#'
#' For index standardization, you may wish to include `0 + as.factor(year)`
#' (or whatever the time column is called) in the formula. See a basic
#' example of index standardization in the relevant
#' [package vignette](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/index-standardization.html).
#' You will need to specify the `time` argument. See [get_index()].
