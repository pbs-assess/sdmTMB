sdmTMB is an R package that fits spatial and spatiotemporal predictive-process GLMMs (Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models) using Template Model Builder ([TMB](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp)), [R-INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/), and Gaussian Markov random fields. One common application is for species distribution models (SDMs). See also the [documentation site](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/index.html).
