# sdmTMB

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/pbs-assess/sdmTMB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pbs-assess/sdmTMB)
[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

The sdmTMB package implements spatiotemporal predictive-process GLMMs (Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models) using Template Model Builder ([TMB](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp)), [R-INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/), and Gaussian Markov random fields. One common application is for spatial or spatiotemporal species distribution models (SDMs).
    
## Installation

You can install sdmTMB with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("pbs-assess/sdmTMB")
```

## Functionality

sdmTMB:

- Fits GLMMs with spatial, spatiotemporal, spatial and spatiotemporal, or AR1 spatiotemporal Gaussian Markov random fields with TMB. It can also fit spatially-varying trends through time as a random field.
- Uses formula interfaces for fixed effects and any time-varying effects (dynamic regression) (e.g. `formula = y ~ 1 + x1, time_varying = ~ 0 + x2`), where `y` is the response, `1` represents an intercept, `0` omits an intercept, `x2` is a covariate with a constant effect, and `x2` is a covariate with a time-varying effect.
- Uses a `family(link)` format similar to `glm()`, lme4, or glmmTMB. This includes Gaussian, Poisson, negative binomial, gamma, binomial, lognormal, Student-t, and Tweedie distributions with identity, log, inverse, and logit links. E.g. `family = tweedie(link = "log")`.
- Has `predict()` and `residuals()` methods. The residuals are randomized-quantile residuals similar to those implemented in the [DHARMa](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DHARMa) package. The `predict()` function can take a `newdata` argument similar to `lm()` or `glm()` etc. The predictions are full predictive-process predictions (i.e. they make smooth pretty maps).
- Includes functionality for estimating the centre of gravity or total biomass by time step for index standardization.
- Implements multi-phase estimation for speed.
- Can optionally allow for anisotropy in the random fields (spatial correlation that is directionally dependent).
- Can generate an SPDE predictive-process mesh based on a clustering algorithm and R-INLA or can take any standard R-INLA mesh created externally as input.

## Examples

The main function is `sdmTMB()`. See `?sdmTMB` and `?predict.sdmTMB` for the most complete examples. There is also a simulation function `?sim` with some examples. There are some vignettes you can see if you build with `devtools::install_github("pbs-assess/sdmTMB", build_vignettes = TRUE)` or look [here](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB/tree/master/vignettes).
