# Fit a spatial or spatiotemporal GLMM with TMB

Fit a spatial or spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed effects model
(GLMM) with the TMB (Template Model Builder) R package. Spatial and
spatiotemporal random fields are approximated using the SPDE (stochastic
partial differential equation) approach, which allows for efficient
modeling of data that are correlated in space and/or time. See the
[model description
vignette](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/model-description.html)
for details.

## Arguments

- formula:

  Model formula. IID random intercepts and slopes are possible using
  lme4 syntax, e.g., `+ (1 | g)` or `+ (0 + depth | g)` or
  `+ (1 + depth | g)` where `g` is a column of class character or factor
  representing groups. Penalized splines are possible via mgcv with
  `s()`. Optionally a list for delta (hurdle) models. See examples and
  details below.

  See the [delta-model
  vignette](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/delta-models.html)
  for details. For binomial family options, see 'Binomial families' in
  the Details section below.

- spatial:

  Estimate spatial random fields? Options are `'on'` / `'off'` or `TRUE`
  / `FALSE`. Optionally, a list for delta models, e.g.
  `list('on', 'off')`.

- spatiotemporal:

  Estimate the spatiotemporal random fields as `'iid'` (independent and
  identically distributed; default), stationary `'ar1'` (first-order
  autoregressive), a random walk (`'rw'`), or fixed at 0 `'off'`. Will
  be set to `'off'` if `time = NULL`. If a delta model, can be a list.
  E.g., `list('off', 'ar1')`. Guidance: Use `'iid'` if temporal
  correlation is negligible or already accounted for in fixed effects;
  `'ar1'` if correlation between consecutive time steps decays
  gradually; `'rw'` if changes between time steps are cumulative (each
  step builds on the last). If the AR1 correlation coefficient (rho) is
  estimated close to 1 (say \> 0.99), consider switching to `'rw'`. See
  the [model description
  vignette](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/model-description.html)
  for mathematical details. Capitalization is ignored. `TRUE` gets
  converted to `'iid'` and `FALSE` gets converted to `'off'`.

- share_range:

  Logical: estimate a shared spatial and spatiotemporal range parameter
  (`TRUE`, default) or independent range parameters (`FALSE`). If a
  delta model, can be a list. E.g., `list(TRUE, FALSE)`.

- time_varying:

  An optional one-sided formula describing covariates that should be
  modelled as a time-varying process. Set the type of process with
  `time_varying_type`. See the help for `time_varying_type` for warnings
  about modelling the first time step. Structure shared in delta models.

- time_varying_type:

  Type of time-varying process to apply to `time_varying` formula.
  Options: `'rw'` (random walk, default), `'rw0'` (random walk with
  mean-zero prior on first time step), or `'ar1'` (autoregressive, for
  coefficients that fluctuate around a mean). For `'rw0'` and `'ar1'`,
  the coefficient starts at zero in the first time step. For `'rw'`
  (default), the first time step is estimated separately—in this case,
  avoid including the same covariates in both `formula` and
  `time_varying` to prevent non-identifiability (use `~ 0` or `~ -1` in
  at least one). Structure shared in delta models.

- spatial_varying:

  An optional one-sided formula of coefficients that should vary in
  space as random fields. Allows the effect of a covariate to differ
  spatially. You likely want to include the same variable as a fixed
  effect in `formula` to estimate the average effect—the spatial field
  then represents deviations from that average (since it has mean zero).
  For example, use `formula = y ~ depth` and
  `spatial_varying = ~ 0 + depth` to model an average depth effect plus
  spatially varying deviations. If a (scaled) time column is used, this
  creates a local-time-trend model. See
  [doi:10.1111/ecog.05176](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.05176) and the
  [spatial trends
  vignette](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/spatial-trend-models.html).
  Predictors should usually be centered to have mean zero and standard
  deviation approximately 1. **The spatial intercept is controlled by
  the `spatial` argument**; set `spatial = 'on'` or `'off'` to include
  or exclude it. For factor predictors, if `spatial_varying` excludes
  the intercept (`~ 0` or `~ -1`), set `spatial = 'off'` to match.
  Structure must be shared in delta models.

- weights:

  A numeric vector representing optional likelihood weights for the
  conditional model. Implemented as in glmmTMB: weights do not have to
  sum to one and are not internally modified. Can also be used for
  trials with the binomial family; the `weights` argument needs to be a
  vector and not a name of the variable in the data frame. See the
  Details section below.

- offset:

  A numeric vector representing the model offset *or* a character value
  representing the column name of the offset. In delta/hurdle models,
  this applies only to the positive component. Usually a log transformed
  variable.

- extra_time:

  Optional extra time slices (e.g., years) to include for interpolation
  or forecasting with the predict function. See the Details section
  below.

- reml:

  Logical: use REML (restricted maximum likelihood) estimation rather
  than maximum likelihood? REML accounts for uncertainty in estimating
  fixed effects and can reduce bias in variance parameter estimates, but
  prevents likelihood-based model comparison (e.g., AIC) between models
  with different fixed effects. Use `TRUE` if your focus is on random
  effect variance parameters; use `FALSE` (default) if comparing models
  with different fixed effects or performing index standardization.

- silent:

  Silent or include optimization details? Helpful to set to `FALSE` for
  models that take a while to fit.

- anisotropy:

  Logical: allow for anisotropy (spatial correlation that is
  directionally dependent)? See
  [`plot_anisotropy()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/plot_anisotropy.md).
  Must be shared across delta models.

- control:

  Optimization control options via
  [`sdmTMBcontrol()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/sdmTMBcontrol.md).

- priors:

  Optional penalties/priors via
  [`sdmTMBpriors()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/priors.md).
  Must currently be shared across delta models.

- knots:

  Optional named list containing knot values to be used for basis
  construction of smoothing terms. See
  [`mgcv::gam()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/gam.html) and
  [`mgcv::gamm()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/gamm.html). E.g.,
  `s(x, bs = 'cc', k = 4), knots = list(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4))`

- bayesian:

  Logical indicating if the model will be passed to tmbstan. If `TRUE`,
  Jacobian adjustments are applied to account for parameter
  transformations when priors are applied.

- previous_fit:

  A previously fitted sdmTMB model to initialize the optimization with.
  Can greatly speed up fitting. Note that the model must be set up
  *exactly* the same way. However, the data and `weights` arguments can
  change, which can be useful for cross-validation.

- do_fit:

  Fit the model (`TRUE`) or return the processed data without fitting
  (`FALSE`)?

- do_index:

  Do index standardization calculations while fitting? Saves memory and
  time when working with large datasets or projection grids since the
  TMB object doesn't have to be rebuilt with
  [`predict.sdmTMB()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/predict.sdmTMB.md)
  and
  [`get_index()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/get_index.md).
  If `TRUE`, then `predict_args` must have a `newdata` element supplied
  and `area` can be supplied to `index_args`. Most users can ignore this
  option. The fitted object can be passed directly to
  [`get_index()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/get_index.md).

- predict_args:

  A list of arguments to pass to
  [`predict.sdmTMB()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/predict.sdmTMB.md)
  **if** `do_index = TRUE`. Most users can ignore this option.

- index_args:

  A list of arguments to pass to
  [`get_index()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/get_index.md)
  **if** `do_index = TRUE`. Currently, only `area` is supported. Bias
  correction can be done when calling
  [`get_index()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/get_index.md)
  on the resulting fitted object. Most users can ignore this option.

- experimental:

  A named list for esoteric or in-development options. Here be dragons.

## Details

**Model description**

sdmTMB fits GLMMs with spatial and/or spatiotemporal random fields,
which account for correlation in the data due to spatial proximity, or
alternatively, latent spatial and spatiotemporal effects. Spatial fields
represent consistent spatial patterns, while spatiotemporal fields
represent spatial patterns that vary over time. See the [model
description](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/model-description.html)
vignette for mathematical details and the paper:
[doi:10.1101/2022.03.24.485545](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.24.485545)

**Binomial families**

Following the structure of
[`stats::glm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html) and glmmTMB, a
binomial family can be specified in one of 4 ways: (1) the response may
be a factor (and the model classifies the first level versus all
others), (2) the response may be binomial (0/1), (3) the response can be
a matrix of form `cbind(success, failure)`, and (4) the response may be
the observed proportions, and the 'weights' argument is used to specify
the Binomial size (N) parameter (`prob ~ ..., weights = N`).

**Smooth terms**

Smooth terms can be included following GAMs (generalized additive
models) using `+ s(x)`, which implements a smooth from
[`mgcv::s()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/s.html). sdmTMB uses
penalized smooths, constructed via
[`mgcv::smooth2random()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/smooth2random.html).
This is a similar approach implemented in gamm4 and brms, among other
packages. Within these smooths, the same syntax commonly used in
[`mgcv::s()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/s.html) or
[`mgcv::t2()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/t2.html) can be applied,
e.g. 2-dimensional smooths may be constructed with `+ s(x, y)` or
`+ t2(x, y)`; smooths can be specific to various factor levels,
`+ s(x, by = group)`; the basis function dimensions may be specified,
e.g. `+ s(x, k = 4)`; and various types of splines may be constructed
such as cyclic splines to model seasonality (perhaps with the `knots`
argument also be supplied).

**Threshold models**

A linear break-point relationship for a covariate can be included via
`+ breakpt(variable)` in the formula, where `variable` is a single
covariate corresponding to a column in `data`. In this case, the
relationship is linear up to a point and then constant (hockey-stick
shaped).

Similarly, a logistic-function threshold model can be included via
`+ logistic(variable)`. This option models the relationship as a
logistic function of the 50% and 95% values. This is similar to length-
or size-based selectivity in fisheries, and is parameterized by the
points at which f(x) = 0.5 or 0.95. See the [threshold
vignette](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/threshold-models.html).

Note that only a single threshold covariate can be included and the same
covariate is included in both components for the delta families.

**Extra time: forecasting or interpolating**

Extra time slices (e.g., years) can be included for interpolation or
forecasting with the predict function via the `extra_time` argument. The
predict function requires all time slices to be defined when fitting the
model to ensure the various time indices are set up correctly. Be
careful if including extra time slices that the model remains
identifiable. For example, including `+ as.factor(year)` in `formula`
will render a model with no data to inform the expected value in a
missing year. `sdmTMB()` makes no attempt to determine if the model
makes sense for forecasting or interpolation. The options
`time_varying`, `spatiotemporal = "rw"`, `spatiotemporal = "ar1"`, or a
smoother on the time column provide mechanisms to predict over missing
time slices with process error.

`extra_time` can also be used to fill in missing time steps for the
purposes of a random walk or AR(1) process if the gaps between time
steps are uneven.

`extra_time` can include only extra time steps or all time steps
including those found in the fitted data. This latter option may be
simpler.

**Regularization and priors**

You can achieve regularization via penalties (priors) on the fixed
effect parameters. See
[`sdmTMBpriors()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/priors.md).
You can fit the model once without penalties and look at the output of
`print(your_model)` or `tidy(your_model)` or fit the model with
`do_fit = FALSE` and inspect `head(your_model$tmb_data$X_ij[[1]])` if
you want to see how the formula is translated to the fixed effect model
matrix. Also see the [Bayesian
vignette](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/bayesian.html).

**Delta/hurdle models**

Delta models (also known as hurdle models) can be fit as two separate
models or at the same time by using an appropriate delta family. E.g.:
[`delta_gamma()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/families.md),
[`delta_beta()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/families.md),
[`delta_lognormal()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/families.md),
and
[`delta_truncated_nbinom2()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/families.md).
If fit with a delta family, by default the formula, spatial, and
spatiotemporal components are shared. Some elements can be specified
independently for the two models using a list format. These include
`formula`, `spatial`, `spatiotemporal`, and `share_range`. The first
element of the list is for the binomial component and the second element
is for the positive component (e.g., Gamma). Other elements must be
shared for now (e.g., spatially varying coefficients, time-varying
coefficients). Furthermore, there are currently limitations if
specifying two formulas as a list: the two formulas cannot have
smoothers or threshold effects. For now, these must be specified through
a single formula that is shared across the two models.

The main advantage of specifying such models using a delta family
(compared to fitting two separate models) is (1) coding simplicity and
(2) calculation of uncertainty on derived quantities such as an index of
abundance with
[`get_index()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/get_index.md)
using the generalized delta method within TMB. Also, selected parameters
can be shared across the models.

See the [delta-model
vignette](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/delta-models.html).

**Index standardization**

For index standardization, you may wish to include `0 + as.factor(year)`
(or whatever the time column is called) in the formula. See a basic
example of index standardization in the relevant [package
vignette](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/index-standardization.html).
You will need to specify the `time` argument. See
[`get_index()`](https://sdmTMB.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/get_index.md).

## Examples

``` r
library(sdmTMB)

# Build a mesh to implement the SPDE approach:
mesh <- make_mesh(pcod_2011, c("X", "Y"), cutoff = 20)

# - this example uses a fairly coarse mesh so these examples run quickly
# - 'cutoff' is the minimum distance between mesh vertices in units of the
#   x and y coordinates
# - 'cutoff = 10' might make more sense in applied situations for this dataset
# - or build any mesh in 'fmesher' and pass it to the 'mesh' argument in make_mesh()`
# - the mesh is not needed if you will be turning off all
#   spatial/spatiotemporal random fields

# Quick mesh plot:
plot(mesh)
