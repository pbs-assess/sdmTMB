# Cross validation with sdmTMB models

Facilitates cross validation with sdmTMB models. Returns the log
likelihood of left-out data, which is similar in spirit to the ELPD
(expected log pointwise predictive density). The function has an option
for leave-future-out cross validation. By default, the function creates
folds randomly but folds can be manually assigned via the `fold_ids`
argument.

## Usage

``` r
sdmTMB_cv(
  formula,
  data,
  mesh_args,
  mesh = NULL,
  time = NULL,
  k_folds = 8,
  fold_ids = NULL,
  lfo = FALSE,
  lfo_forecast = 1,
  lfo_validations = 5,
  parallel = TRUE,
  use_initial_fit = FALSE,
  future_globals = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- formula:

  Model formula.

- data:

  A data frame.

- mesh_args:

  Arguments for
  [`make_mesh()`](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/make_mesh.md).
  If supplied, the mesh will be reconstructed for each fold.

- mesh:

  Output from
  [`make_mesh()`](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/make_mesh.md).
  If supplied, the mesh will be constant across folds.

- time:

  The name of the time column. Leave as `NULL` if this is only spatial
  data.

- k_folds:

  Number of folds.

- fold_ids:

  Optional vector containing user fold IDs. Can also be a single string,
  e.g. `"fold_id"` representing the name of the variable in `data`.
  Ignored if `lfo` is TRUE

- lfo:

  Whether to implement leave-future-out (LFO) cross validation where
  data are used to predict future folds. `time` argument in
  [`sdmTMB()`](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/sdmTMB.md)
  must be specified. See Details section below.

- lfo_forecast:

  If `lfo = TRUE`, number of time steps to forecast. Time steps 1, ...,
  T are used to predict T + `lfo_forecast` and the last forecasted time
  step is used for validation. See Details section below.

- lfo_validations:

  If `lfo = TRUE`, number of times to step through the LFOCV process.
  Defaults to 5. See Details section below.

- parallel:

  If `TRUE` and a
  [`future::plan()`](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html)
  is supplied, will be run in parallel.

- use_initial_fit:

  Fit the first fold and use those parameter values as starting values
  for subsequent folds? Can be faster with many folds.

- future_globals:

  A character vector of global variables used within arguments if an
  error is returned that future.apply can't find an object. This vector
  is appended to `TRUE` and passed to the argument `future.globals` in
  [`future.apply::future_lapply()`](https://future.apply.futureverse.org/reference/future_lapply.html).
  Useful if global objects are used to specify arguments like priors,
  families, etc.

- ...:

  All other arguments required to run
  [`sdmTMB()`](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/reference/sdmTMB.md)
  model with the exception of `weights`, which are used to define the
  folds.

## Value

A list:

- `data`: Original data plus columns for fold ID, CV predicted value,
  and CV log likelihood.

- `models`: A list of models; one per fold.

- `fold_loglik`: Sum of left-out log likelihoods per fold. More positive
  values are better.

- `sum_loglik`: Sum of `fold_loglik` across all left-out data. More
  positive values are better.

- `pdHess`: Logical vector: Hessian was invertible each fold?

- `converged`: Logical: all `pdHess` `TRUE`?

- `max_gradients`: Max gradient per fold.

Prior to sdmTMB version '0.3.0.9002', `elpd` was incorrectly returned as
the log average likelihood, which is another metric you could compare
models with, but not ELPD. For maximum likelihood, [ELPD is equivalent
in spirit to the sum of the log
likelihoods](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB/issues/235).

## Details

**Parallel processing**

Parallel processing can be used by setting a
[`future::plan()`](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html).

For example:

    library(future)
    plan(multisession)
    # now use sdmTMB_cv() ...

**Leave-future-out cross validation (LFOCV)**

An example of LFOCV with 9 time steps, `lfo_forecast = 1`, and
`lfo_validations = 2`:

- Fit data to time steps 1 to 7, predict and validate step 8.

- Fit data to time steps 1 to 8, predict and validate step 9.

An example of LFOCV with 9 time steps, `lfo_forecast = 2`, and
`lfo_validations = 3`:

- Fit data to time steps 1 to 5, predict and validate step 7.

- Fit data to time steps 1 to 6, predict and validate step 8.

- Fit data to time steps 1 to 7, predict and validate step 9.

Note these are time steps as they are presented in order in the data.
For example, in the `pcod` data example below steps between data points
are not always one year but an `lfo_forecast = 2` forecasts 2 time steps
as presented not two years.

See example below.
